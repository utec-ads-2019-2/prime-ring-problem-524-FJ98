/* 524 - PRIME RING PROBLEM
 * A ring is composed of n(even number) circles as shown in diagram.
 * Put natural numbers 1;2;:::;n in to each circle separately,
 * and the sum of numbers in two adjacent circles should be a prime.
 * Note: the number of first circle should always be 1.
 *
 * INPUT:
 * n(0 < n <= 16)
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 * The output format is shown as sample below.
 * Each row represents a series of circle numbers in the ring beginning from 1 clock wisely and anti clock wisely.
 * The order of numbers must satisfy the above requirements.You are to write a program that completes above process */
